### PhyGPT-Compiler

* This project is about <b>Compiler for solving Kinematic Equations</b> developed by Devanshu Shah, Hetav Shah, Jittam Sakhia, Kathan Shah and Jay Ratiya; the students of Dharmsinh Desai University, Department of Information Technology.

### Description
* This project aims to develop a compiler for solving Kinematic Equations. The project includes the implementation of the following components:

1. DFA: This component represents the DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) for the PhyGPT program.

2. Scanner Phase in Lex: This component is used to implement the scanner phase in Lex. It includes the implementation of regular expressions for the tokens of the PhyGPT program.

3. Yacc: This component is used to implement the parser phase of the calculator program using Yacc (Yet Another Compiler Compiler). It includes the implementation of the grammar rules for the PhyGPT program.

### Getting Started
1. To run the lex file for ```scanner phase```
```
flex lex.l
```

2. To run ```yacc file```
```
bison -dy yacc.y
```

3. To run both the generated files
```
gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o project.exe
```
